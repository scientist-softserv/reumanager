## Info
This program facilitates the application process for science oriented [NSF REU programs](http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/) and is developed by the IT staff of the [UC San Diego Institute of Engineering in Medicine](https://iem.ucsd.edu/).

[REU Manager](https://reumanager.com) is built with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and is completely free to host/maintain yourself.   You can see a demonstration of the site at: https://reumanager.com/new_demo .  You may login as the administrative user with the email admin@reumanager.com and the password DemoApp.

Below are instructions for those who wish to install and maintain the application using their own equipment.
